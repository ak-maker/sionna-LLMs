"# MIMO OFDM Transmissions over the CDL Channel Model\n\nIn this notebook, you will learn how to setup a realistic simulation of a MIMO point-to-point link between a mobile user terminal (UT) and a base station (BS). Both, uplink and downlink directions are considered. Here is a schematic diagram of the system model with all required components:\n\n\nThe setup includes:\n\n- 5G LDPC FEC\n- QAM modulation\n- OFDM resource grid with configurabel pilot pattern\n- Multiple data streams\n- 3GPP 38.901 CDL channel models and antenna patterns\n- ZF Precoding with perfect channel state information\n- LS Channel estimation with nearest-neighbor interpolation as well as perfect CSI\n- LMMSE MIMO equalization\n\n\nYou will learn how to simulate the channel in the time and frequency domains and understand when to use which option.\n\nIn particular, you will investigate:\n\n- The performance over different CDL models\n- The impact of imperfect CSI\n- Channel aging due to mobility\n- Inter-symbol interference due to insufficient cyclic prefix length\n\n\nWe will first walk through the configuration of all components of the system model, before simulating some simple transmissions in the time and frequency domain. Then, we will build a general Keras model which will allow us to run efficiently simulations with different parameter settings.\n\nThis is a notebook demonstrating a fairly advanced use of the Sionna library. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the API documentation of the [Channel](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html) module and understand the difference between time- and frequency-domain modeling. Some of the simulations take some time, especially when you have no GPU available. For this reason, we provide the simulation results within the cells generating the figures. If you want to\nvisualize your own results, just comment the corresponding line."
"### Stream Management\n\nFor any type of MIMO simulations, it is useful to setup a [StreamManagement](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/mimo.html#stream-management) object. It determines which transmitters and receivers communicate data streams with each other. In our scenario, we will configure a single UT and BS with multiple antennas each. Whether the UT or BS is considered as a transmitter depends on the `direction`, which can be either uplink or downlink. The\n[StreamManagement](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/mimo.html#stream-management) has many properties that are used by other components, such as precoding and equalization.\n\nWe will configure the system here such that the number of streams per transmitter (in both uplink and donwlink) is equal to the number of UT antennas.\n\n\n```python\n# Define the number of UT and BS antennas.\n# For the CDL model, that will be used in this notebook, only\n# a single UT and BS are supported.\nnum_ut = 1\nnum_bs = 1\nnum_ut_ant = 4\nnum_bs_ant = 8\n# The number of transmitted streams is equal to the number of UT antennas\n# in both uplink and downlink\nnum_streams_per_tx = num_ut_ant\n# Create an RX-TX association matrix\n# rx_tx_association[i,j]=1 means that receiver i gets at least one stream\n# from transmitter j. Depending on the transmission direction (uplink or downlink),\n# the role of UT and BS can change. However, as we have only a single\n# transmitter and receiver, this does not matter:\nrx_tx_association = np.array([[1]])\n# Instantiate a StreamManagement object\n# This determines which data streams are determined for which receiver.\n# In this simple setup, this is fairly easy. However, it can get more involved\n# for simulations with many transmitters and receivers.\nsm = StreamManagement(rx_tx_association, num_streams_per_tx)\n```"
"### OFDM Resource Grid & Pilot Pattern\n\nNext, we configure an OFDM [ResourceGrid](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/ofdm.html#resource-grid) spanning multiple OFDM symbols. The resource grid contains data symbols and pilots and is equivalent to a *slot* in 4G/5G terminology. Although it is not relevant for our simulation, we null the DC subcarrier and a few guard carriers to the left and right of the spectrum. Also a cyclic prefix is added.\n\nDuring the creation of the [ResourceGrid](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/ofdm.html#resource-grid), a [PilotPattern](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/ofdm.html#pilot-pattern) is automatically generated. We could have alternatively created a [PilotPattern](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/ofdm.html#pilot-pattern) first and then provided it as initialization parameter.\n\n\n```python\nrg = ResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=14,\n                  fft_size=76,\n                  subcarrier_spacing=15e3,\n                  num_tx=1,\n                  num_streams_per_tx=num_streams_per_tx,\n                  cyclic_prefix_length=6,\n                  num_guard_carriers=[5,6],\n                  dc_null=True,\n                  pilot_pattern=\"kronecker\",\n                  pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices=[2,11])\nrg.show();\n```\n\n\nAs can be seen in the figure above, the resource grid spans 76 subcarriers over 14 OFDM symbols. A DC guard carrier as well as some guard carriers to the left and right of the spectrum are nulled. The third and twelfth OFDM symbol are dedicated to pilot transmissions.\n\nLet us now have a look at the pilot pattern used by the transmitter.\n\n\n```python\nrg.pilot_pattern.show();\n```\n\n\nThe pilot patterns are defined over the resource grid of *effective subcarriers* from which the nulled DC and guard carriers have been removed. This leaves us in our case with 76 - 1 (DC) - 5 (left guards) - 6 (right guards) = 64 effective subcarriers.\n\nWhile the resource grid only knows which resource elements are reserved for pilots, it is the pilot pattern that defines what is actually transmitted on them. In our scenario, we have four transmit streams and configured the [KroneckerPilotPattern](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/ofdm.html#kroneckerpilotpattern). All streams use orthogonal pilot sequences, i.e., one pilot on every fourth subcarrier. You have full freedom to configure your own\n[PilotPattern](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/ofdm.html#pilotpattern).\n\nLet us now have a look at the actual pilot sequences for all streams which consists of random QPSK symbols. By default, the pilot sequences are normalized, such that the average power per pilot symbol is equal to one. As only every fourth pilot symbol in the sequence is used, their amplitude is scaled by a factor of two."
"```python\nplt.figure()\nplt.title(\"Real Part of the Pilot Sequences\")\nfor i in range(num_streams_per_tx):\n    plt.stem(np.real(rg.pilot_pattern.pilots[0, i]),\n             markerfmt=\"C{}.\".format(i), linefmt=\"C{}-\".format(i),\n             label=\"Stream {}\".format(i))\nplt.legend()\nprint(\"Average energy per pilot symbol: {:1.2f}\".format(np.mean(np.abs(rg.pilot_pattern.pilots[0,0])**2)))\n```\n\n\n```python\nAverage energy per pilot symbol: 1.00\n```"
"### Antenna Arrays\n\nNext, we need to configure the antenna arrays used by the UT and BS. This can be ignored for simple channel models, such as [AWGN](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#awgn), [flat-fading](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#flat-fading-channel), [RayleighBlockFading](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#rayleigh-block-fading), or [TDL](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#tapped-delay-line-tdl) which do not account for antenna array\ngeometries and antenna radiation patterns. However, other models, such as [CDL](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#clustered-delay-line-cdl), [UMi](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#urban-microcell-umi), [UMa](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#urban-macrocell-uma), and [RMa](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#rural-macrocell-rma) from the 3GPP 38.901 specification, require it.\n\nWe will assume here that UT and BS antenna arrays are composed of dual cross-polarized antenna elements with an antenna pattern defined in the 3GPP 38.901 specification. By default, the antenna elements are spaced half of a wavelength apart in both vertical and horizontal directions. You can define your own antenna geometries an radiation patterns if needed.\n\nAn [AntennaArray](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#antennaarray) is always defined in the y-z plane. Its final orientation will be determined by the orientation of the UT or BS. This parameter can be configured in the [ChannelModel](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#channel-model-interface) that we will create later.\n\n\n```python\ncarrier_frequency = 2.6e9 # Carrier frequency in Hz.\n                          # This is needed here to define the antenna element spacing.\nut_array = AntennaArray(num_rows=1,\n                        num_cols=int(num_ut_ant/2),\n                        polarization=\"dual\",\n                        polarization_type=\"cross\",\n                        antenna_pattern=\"38.901\",\n                        carrier_frequency=carrier_frequency)\nut_array.show()\nbs_array = AntennaArray(num_rows=1,\n                        num_cols=int(num_bs_ant/2),\n                        polarization=\"dual\",\n                        polarization_type=\"cross\",\n                        antenna_pattern=\"38.901\",\n                        carrier_frequency=carrier_frequency)\nbs_array.show()\n```"
"### CDL Channel Model\n\nNow, we will create an instance of the CDL channel model.\n\n\n```python\ndelay_spread = 300e-9 # Nominal delay spread in [s]. Please see the CDL documentation\n                      # about how to choose this value.\ndirection = \"uplink\"  # The `direction` determines if the UT or BS is transmitting.\n                      # In the `uplink`, the UT is transmitting.\ncdl_model = \"B\"       # Suitable values are [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"]\nspeed = 10            # UT speed [m/s]. BSs are always assumed to be fixed.\n                      # The direction of travel will chosen randomly within the x-y plane.\n# Configure a channel impulse reponse (CIR) generator for the CDL model.\n# cdl() will generate CIRs that can be converted to discrete time or discrete frequency.\ncdl = CDL(cdl_model, delay_spread, carrier_frequency, ut_array, bs_array, direction, min_speed=speed)\n```"
"#### CIR Sampling Process\n\nThe instance `cdl` of the [CDL](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#clustered-delay-line-cdl) [ChannelModel](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#channel-model-interface) can be used to generate batches of random realizations of continuous-time channel impulse responses, consisting of complex gains `a` and delays `tau` for each path. To account for time-varying channels, a channel impulse responses is sampled at the `sampling_frequency` for\n`num_time_samples` samples. For more details on this, please have a look at the [API documentation](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html) of the channel models.\n\nIn order to model the channel in the frequency domain, we need `num_ofdm_symbols` samples that are taken once per `ofdm_symbol_duration`, which corresponds to the length of an OFDM symbol plus the cyclic prefix.\n\n\n```python\na, tau = cdl(batch_size=32, num_time_steps=rg.num_ofdm_symbols, sampling_frequency=1/rg.ofdm_symbol_duration)\n```\nThe path gains `a` have shape\n`[batch` `size,` `num_rx,` `num_rx_ant,` `num_tx,` `num_tx_ant,` `num_paths,` `num_time_steps]`\nand the delays `tau` have shape\n`[batch_size,` `num_rx,` `num_tx,` `num_paths]`.\n\n\n```python\nprint(\"Shape of the path gains: \", a.shape)\nprint(\"Shape of the delays:\", tau.shape)\n```\n\n\n```python\nShape of the path gains:  (32, 1, 8, 1, 4, 23, 14)\nShape of the delays: (32, 1, 1, 23)\n```\n\n\nThe delays are assumed to be static within the time-window of interest. Only the complex path gains change over time. The following two figures depict the channel impulse response at a particular time instant and the time-evolution of the gain of one path, respectively.\n\n\n```python\nplt.figure()\nplt.title(\"Channel impulse response realization\")\nplt.stem(tau[0,0,0,:]/1e-9, np.abs(a)[0,0,0,0,0,:,0])\nplt.xlabel(r\"$\\tau$ [ns]\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"$|a|$\")\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.title(\"Time evolution of path gain\")\nplt.plot(np.arange(rg.num_ofdm_symbols)*rg.ofdm_symbol_duration/1e-6, np.real(a)[0,0,0,0,0,0,:])\nplt.plot(np.arange(rg.num_ofdm_symbols)*rg.ofdm_symbol_duration/1e-6, np.imag(a)[0,0,0,0,0,0,:])\nplt.legend([\"Real part\", \"Imaginary part\"])\nplt.xlabel(r\"$t$ [us]\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"$a$\");\n```"
"#### Generate the Channel Frequency Response\n\nIf we want to use the continuous-time channel impulse response to simulate OFDM transmissions under ideal conditions, i.e., no inter-symbol interference, inter-carrier interference, etc., we need to convert it to the frequency domain.\n\nThis can be done with the function [cir_to_ofdm_channel](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#cir-to-ofdm-channel) that computes the Fourier transform of the continuous-time channel impulse response at a set of `frequencies`, corresponding to the different subcarriers. The frequencies can be obtained with the help of the convenience function [subcarrier_frequencies](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#subcarrier-frequencies).\n\n\n```python\nfrequencies = subcarrier_frequencies(rg.fft_size, rg.subcarrier_spacing)\nh_freq = cir_to_ofdm_channel(frequencies, a, tau, normalize=True)\n```\n\n\nLet us have a look at the channel frequency response at a given time instant:\n\n\n```python\nplt.figure()\nplt.title(\"Channel frequency response\")\nplt.plot(np.real(h_freq[0,0,0,0,0,0,:]))\nplt.plot(np.imag(h_freq[0,0,0,0,0,0,:]))\nplt.xlabel(\"OFDM Symbol Index\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"$h$\")\nplt.legend([\"Real part\", \"Imaginary part\"]);\n```\n\n\nWe can apply the channel frequency response to a given input with the [ApplyOFDMChannel](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#applyofdmchannel) layer. This layer can also add additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) to the channel output.\n\n\n```python\n# Function that will apply the channel frequency response to an input signal\nchannel_freq = ApplyOFDMChannel(add_awgn=True)\n```"
"#### Generate the Discrete-Time Channel Impulse Response\n\nIn the same way as we have created the frequency channel impulse response from the continuous-time response, we can use the latter to compute a discrete-time impulse response. This can then be used to model the channel in the time-domain through discrete convolution with an input signal. Time-domain channel modeling is necessary whenever we want to deviate from the perfect OFDM scenario, e.g., OFDM without cyclic prefix, inter-subcarrier interference due to carrier-frequency offsets, phase\nnoise, or very high Doppler spread scenarios, as well as other single or multicarrier waveforms (OTFS, FBMC, UFMC, etc).\n\nA discrete-time impulse response can be obtained with the help of the function [cir_to_time_channel](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#cir-to-time-channel) that requires a `bandwidth` parameter. This function first applies a perfect low-pass filter of the provided `bandwith` to the continuous-time channel impulse response and then samples the filtered response at the Nyquist rate. The resulting discrete-time impulse response is then truncated to finite length, depending on\nthe delay spread. `l_min` and `l_max` denote truncation boundaries and the resulting channel has `l_tot=l_max-l_min+1` filter taps. A detailed mathematical description of this process is provided in the API documentation of the channel models. You can freely chose both parameters if you do not want to rely on the default values.\n\nIn order to model the channel in the domain, the continuous-time channel impulse response must be sampled at the Nyquist rate. We also need now `num_ofdm_symbols` `x` `(fft_size` `+` `cyclic_prefix_length)` `+` `l_tot-1` samples in contrast to `num_ofdm_symbols` samples for modeling in the frequency domain. This implies that the memory requirements of time-domain channel modeling is significantly higher. We therefore recommend to only use this feature if it is really necessary. Simulations with many\ntransmitters, receivers, and/or large antenna arrays become otherwise quickly prohibitively complex.\n\n\n```python\n# The following values for truncation are recommended.\n# Please feel free to tailor them to you needs.\nl_min, l_max = time_lag_discrete_time_channel(rg.bandwidth)\nl_tot = l_max-l_min+1\na, tau = cdl(batch_size=2, num_time_steps=rg.num_time_samples+l_tot-1, sampling_frequency=rg.bandwidth)\n```"
"```python\nh_time = cir_to_time_channel(rg.bandwidth, a, tau, l_min=l_min, l_max=l_max, normalize=True)\n```\n\n```python\nplt.figure()\nplt.title(\"Discrete-time channel impulse response\")\nplt.stem(np.abs(h_time[0,0,0,0,0,0]))\nplt.xlabel(r\"Time step $\\ell$\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"$|\\bar{h}|$\");\n```\n\n\nWe can apply the discrete-time impulse response to a given input with the [ApplyTimeChannel](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#applytimechannel) layer. This layer can also add additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) to the channel output.\n\n\n```python\n# Function that will apply the discrete-time channel impulse response to an input signal\nchannel_time = ApplyTimeChannel(rg.num_time_samples, l_tot=l_tot, add_awgn=True)\n```"
"### Other Physical Layer Components\n\nFinally, we create instances of all other physical layer components we need. Most of these layers are self-explanatory. For more information, please have a look at the API documentation.\n\n\n```python\nnum_bits_per_symbol = 2 # QPSK modulation\ncoderate = 0.5 # Code rate\nn = int(rg.num_data_symbols*num_bits_per_symbol) # Number of coded bits\nk = int(n*coderate) # Number of information bits\n# The binary source will create batches of information bits\nbinary_source = BinarySource()\n# The encoder maps information bits to coded bits\nencoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n# The mapper maps blocks of information bits to constellation symbols\nmapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n# The resource grid mapper maps symbols onto an OFDM resource grid\nrg_mapper = ResourceGridMapper(rg)\n# The zero forcing precoder precodes the transmit stream towards the intended antennas\nzf_precoder = ZFPrecoder(rg, sm, return_effective_channel=True)\n# OFDM modulator and demodulator\nmodulator = OFDMModulator(rg.cyclic_prefix_length)\ndemodulator = OFDMDemodulator(rg.fft_size, l_min, rg.cyclic_prefix_length)\n# This function removes nulled subcarriers from any tensor having the shape of a resource grid\nremove_nulled_scs = RemoveNulledSubcarriers(rg)\n# The LS channel estimator will provide channel estimates and error variances\nls_est = LSChannelEstimator(rg, interpolation_type=\"nn\")\n# The LMMSE equalizer will provide soft symbols together with noise variance estimates\nlmmse_equ = LMMSEEqualizer(rg, sm)\n# The demapper produces LLR for all coded bits\ndemapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n# The decoder provides hard-decisions on the information bits\ndecoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n```"
"### Uplink Transmission in the Frequency Domain\n\nNow, we will simulate our first uplink transmission! Inspect the code to understand how perfect CSI at the receiver can be simulated.\n\n\n```python\nbatch_size = 32 # Depending on the memory of your GPU (or system when a CPU is used),\n                # you can in(de)crease the batch size.

Using this function, we could have used the following code:"
"```python\nofdm_channel = OFDMChannel(cdl, rg, add_awgn=True, normalize_channel=True, return_channel=True)\ny, h_freq = ofdm_channel([x_rg, no])\n```"
"### Uplink Transmission in the Time Domain\n\nIn the previous example, OFDM modulation/demodulation were not needed as the entire system was simulated in the frequency domain. However, this modeling approach is not able to capture many realistic effects.\n\nWith the following modifications, the system can be modeled in the time domain.\n\nHave a careful look at how perfect CSI of the channel frequency response is simulated here.\n\n\n```python\nbatch_size = 4 # We pick a small batch_size as executing this code in Eager mode could consume a lot of memory\nebno_db = 30\nperfect_csi = True\nno = ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol, coderate, rg)\nb = binary_source([batch_size, 1, rg.num_streams_per_tx, encoder.k])\nc = encoder(b)\nx = mapper(c)\nx_rg = rg_mapper(x)\n# The CIR needs to be sampled every 1/bandwith [s].\n# In contrast to frequency-domain modeling, this implies\n# that the channel can change over the duration of a single\n# OFDM symbol.

"```python\nBER: 0.0\n```\n\n\nAn alternative approach to simulations in the time domain is to use the convenience function [TimeChannel](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.html#timechannel) that jointly generates and applies the discrete-time channel impulse response. Using this function, we could have used the following code:\n\n\n```python\ntime_channel = TimeChannel(cdl, rg.bandwidth, rg.num_time_samples,\n                           l_min=l_min, l_max=l_max, normalize_channel=True,\n                           add_awgn=True, return_channel=True)\ny_time, h_time = time_channel([x_time, no])\n```\n\n\nNext, we will compare the perfect CSI that we computed above using the ideal channel frequency response and the estimated channel response that we obtain from pilots with nearest-neighbor interpolation based on simulated transmissions in the time domain.\n\n\n```python\n# In the example above, we assumed perfect CSI, i.e.,\n# h_hat correpsond to the exact ideal channel frequency response.\nh_perf = h_hat[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n# We now compute the LS channel estimate from the pilots.\nh_est, _ = ls_est ([y, no])\nh_est = h_est[0,0,0,0,0,0]\n```\n\n```python\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(np.real(h_perf))\nplt.plot(np.imag(h_perf))\nplt.plot(np.real(h_est), \"--\")\nplt.plot(np.imag(h_est), \"--\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Subcarrier index\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Channel frequency response\")\nplt.legend([\"Ideal (real part)\", \"Ideal (imaginary part)\", \"Estimated (real part)\", \"Estimated (imaginary part)\"]);\nplt.title(\"Comparison of channel frequency responses\");\n```"
"### Downlink Transmission in the Frequency Domain\n\nWe will now simulate a simple downlink transmission in the frequency domain. In contrast to the uplink, the transmitter is now assumed to precode independent data streams to each antenna of the receiver based on perfect CSI.\n\nThe receiver can either estimate the channel or get access to the effective channel after precoding.\n\nThe first thing to do, is to change the `direction` within the CDL model.This makes the BS the transmitter and the UT the receiver.\n\n\n```python\ndirection = \"downlink\"\ncdl = CDL(cdl_model, delay_spread, carrier_frequency, ut_array, bs_array, direction, min_speed=speed)\n```\n\n\nThe following code shows the other necessary modifications:\n\n\n```python\nperfect_csi = True # Change to switch between perfect and imperfect CSI\nno = ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol, coderate, rg)\nb = binary_source([batch_size, 1, rg.num_streams_per_tx, encoder.k])\nc = encoder(b)\nx = mapper(c)\nx_rg = rg_mapper(x)\ncir = cdl(batch_size, rg.num_ofdm_symbols, 1/rg.ofdm_symbol_duration)\nh_freq = cir_to_ofdm_channel(frequencies, *cir, normalize=True)\n# Precode the transmit signal in the frequency domain\n# It is here assumed that the transmitter has perfect knowledge of the channel\n# One could here reduce this to perfect knowledge of the channel for the first\n# OFDM symbol, or a noisy version of it to take outdated transmit CSI into account.\n# `g` is the post-beamforming or `effective channel` that can be\n# used to simulate perfect CSI at the receiver.\nx_rg, g = zf_precoder([x_rg, h_freq])\ny = channel_freq([x_rg, h_freq, no])\nif perfect_csi:\n    # The receiver gets here the effective channel after precoding as CSI\n    h_hat, err_var = g, 0.\nelse:\n    h_hat, err_var = ls_est ([y, no])\nx_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equ([y, h_hat, err_var, no])\nllr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\nb_hat = decoder(llr)\nber = compute_ber(b, b_hat)\nprint(\"BER: {}\".format(ber))\n```\n\n\n```python\nBER: 0.0\n```"
"We do not explain here on purpose how to model the downlink transmission in the time domain as it is a good exercise for the reader to do it her/himself. The key steps are:\n\n- Sample the channel impulse response at the Nyquist rate.\n- Downsample it to the OFDM symbol (+ cyclic prefix) rate (look at the uplink example).\n- Convert the downsampled CIR to the frequency domain.\n- Give this CSI to the transmitter for precoding.\n- Convert the CIR to discrete-time to compute the channel output in the time domain."
"### Understand the Difference Between the CDL Models\n\nBefore we proceed with more advanced simulations, it is important to understand the differences between the different CDL models. The models A, B, and C are non-line-of-sight (NLOS) models, while D and E are LOS. In the following code snippet, we compute the empirical cummulative distribution function (CDF) of the condition number of the channel frequency response matrix between all receiver and transmit antennas.\n\n\n```python\ndef fun(cdl_model):\n    \"\"\"Generates a histogram of the channel condition numbers\"\"\"\n    # Setup a CIR generator\n    cdl = CDL(cdl_model, delay_spread, carrier_frequency,\n              ut_array, bs_array, \"uplink\", min_speed=0)\n    # Generate random CIR realizations\n    # As we nned only a single sample in time, the sampling_frequency\n    # does not matter.\n    cir = cdl(2000, 1, 1)\n    # Compute the frequency response\n    h = cir_to_ofdm_channel(frequencies, *cir, normalize=True)\n    # Reshape to [batch_size, fft_size, num_rx_ant, num_tx_ant]\n    h = tf.squeeze(h)\n    h = tf.transpose(h, [0,3,1,2])\n    # Compute condition number\n    c = np.reshape(np.linalg.cond(h), [-1])\n    # Compute normalized histogram\n    hist, bins = np.histogram(c, 150, (1, 150))\n    hist = hist/np.sum(hist)\n    return bins[:-1], hist\nplt.figure()\nfor cdl_model in [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"]:\n    bins, hist = fun(cdl_model)\n    plt.plot(bins, np.cumsum(hist))\nplt.xlim([0,150])\nplt.legend([\"CDL-A\", \"CDL-B\", \"CDL-C\", \"CDL-D\", \"CDL-E\"]);\nplt.xlabel(\"Channel Condition Number\")\nplt.ylabel(\"CDF\")\nplt.title(\"CDF of the condition number of 8x4 MIMO channels\");\n```\n\n\nFrom the figure above, you can observe that the CDL-B and CDL-C models are substantially better conditioned than the other models. This makes them more suitable for MIMO transmissions as we will observe in the next section."
"### Create an End-to-End Keras Model\n\nFor longer simulations, it is often convenient to pack all code into a single Keras model that outputs batches of transmitted and received information bits at a given Eb/No point. The following code defines a very general model that can simulate uplink and downlink transmissions with time or frequency domain modeling over the different CDL models. It allows to configure perfect or imperfect CSI, UT speed, cyclic prefix length, and the number of OFDM symbols for pilot transmissions.\n\n\n```python\n# We need to enable sionna.config.xla_compat before we can use\n# tf.function with jit_compile=True.\nsionna.config.xla_compat=True\nclass Model(tf.keras.Model):\n    \"\"\"This Keras model simulates OFDM MIMO transmissions over the CDL model.\n    Simulates point-to-point transmissions between a UT and a BS.\n    Uplink and downlink transmissions can be realized with either perfect CSI\n    or channel estimation.

"### Evaluate the Impact of Mobility\n\nLet us now have a look at the impact of the UT speed on the uplink performance. We compare the scenarios of perfect and imperfect CSI and 0 m/s and 20 m/s speed. To amplify the detrimental effects of high mobility, we only configure a single OFDM symbol for pilot transmissions at the beginning of the resource grid. With perfect CSI, mobility plays hardly any role.

Having no cyclic prefix translates simply into an improved Eb/No as no energy for its transmission is used.\n\nSimulating a channel in the time domain requires significantly more memory and compute which might limit the scenarios for which it can be used.\n\nIf you do not want to run the simulation your self, you skip the next cell and visualize the result in the next cell.\n\n\n```python\nCP_SIMS = {\n    \"ebno_db\" : list(np.arange(0, 16, 1.0)),\n    \"cdl_model\" : \"C\",\n    \"delay_spread\" : 100e-9,\n    \"subcarrier_spacing\" : 15e3,\n    \"domain\" : [\"freq\", \"time\"],\n    \"direction\" : \"uplink\",\n    \"perfect_csi\" : False,\n    \"speed\" : 3.0,\n    \"cyclic_prefix_length\" : [20, 4],\n    \"pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices\" : [2, 11],\n    \"ber\" : [],\n    \"bler\" : [],\n    \"duration\": None\n}\nstart = time.time()\nfor cyclic_prefix_length in CP_SIMS[\"cyclic_prefix_length\"]:\n    for domain in CP_SIMS[\"domain\"]:\n        model = Model(domain=domain,\n                  direction=CP_SIMS[\"direction\"],\n                  cdl_model=CP_SIMS[\"cdl_model\"],\n                  delay_spread=CP_SIMS[\"delay_spread\"],\n                  perfect_csi=CP_SIMS[\"perfect_csi\"],\n                  speed=CP_SIMS[\"speed\"],\n                  cyclic_prefix_length=cyclic_prefix_length,\n                  pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices=CP_SIMS[\"pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices\"],\n                  subcarrier_spacing=CP_SIMS[\"subcarrier_spacing\"])\n        ber, bler = sim_ber(model,\n                        CP_SIMS[\"ebno_db\"],\n                        batch_size=256,\n                        max_mc_iter=100,\n                        num_target_block_errors=1000)\n        CP_SIMS[\"ber\"].append(list(ber.numpy()))\n        CP_SIMS[\"bler\"].append(list(bler.numpy()))\nCP_SIMS[\"duration\"] = time.time() - start\n```"

At high SNR, inter-symbol interference (from multiple streams) becomes the dominating source of interference.\n</ol>\n</ol>\n</ol>"
